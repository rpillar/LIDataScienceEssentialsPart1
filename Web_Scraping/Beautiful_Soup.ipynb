    "<h2>IoT Automation Ideas</h2>\n",
    "Almost all new IoT device ideas offer automation benefits, but to outline a few more ideas:\n",
    "<ol>\n",
    " \t<li>Build an IoT device that automatically locates and reports the closest nearby parking spot.</li>\n",
    " \t<li>Build a motion detection system that automatically issues emails or sms messages to alert home owners of a likely home invasion.</li>\n",
